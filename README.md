Viber out of the box dosn't support autostart in tray.

Run "ViberSetup TrayScripts.bat" once when Viber is installed, it will create a win-scheduler rule to hide Viber window on system start. 
Scheduler works totally in background, no command line windows will be visible during execution

Checked in Windows 10
